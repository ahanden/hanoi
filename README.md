# hanoi
This is an HTML implementation of the Towers of Hanoi. It makes use of JQuery and JQuery UI mostly. One can add any 
number of disks for the three towers, and there is a button that solves the game as well.

The solver does not actually use a recursive or dynamic programming method, but rather an iterative one. Of course,
this isn't visible to users - just to those who read the source code.
